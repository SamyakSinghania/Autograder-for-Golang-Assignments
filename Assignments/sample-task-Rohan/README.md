### Task
* Install **Go**
* Install **Git**
* Install **Goland**
* Create account on **Github**
* Apply for **Student Developer Pack** (optional)
* Do the [official tutorial](https://go.dev/tour/) only till the **Methods and Interfaces** part.

You need to edit `task.go` only. After you make any small changes, open `task_test.go`, and click on the `Run` icon to the left. You should see the results of the test at the bottom of the screen.

Once all tests are green, you're good to go.

### Submission
Install `git` and commit your changes via

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your message goes here"
git push
```

Then, open the github repository, and go to `Actions` tab. If you see a green tick, it means that you've successfully completed the assignment. If you see a red cross, your tests failed. Expand it to view more details, and make the necessary changes.

### Help
If you face any issues in the installation/setup phase, or compilation errors that you can't resolve, you can ask your dobuts on the `cf-stress` channel on `pClub` discord server.
